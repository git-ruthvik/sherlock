# sherlock

Sherlock is a mechanism with a hardware and software implementation capable of monitoring the presence of wireless devices around it through evidence left in the wireless environment.

This page is intended to provide information and the source code of an implementation of the Sherlock engine used for conducting academic experiments. This opening of the dataset and the source code allows other researchers to replicate the experiments independently.
